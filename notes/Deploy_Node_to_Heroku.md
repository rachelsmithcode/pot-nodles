#Deploying Node to Heroku

You can deploy though git, just as we did with our Ruby apps.

##Before starting you need to:
  1. install git
  2. sign up to Heroku
  3. install Heroku toolbelt
  4. add /node_modules to your .gitignore file 

* Go to the Heroku home page and install node.js

* Create your package.json file:
  * From inside the directory in the terminal type:
      ```$ npm init```
  * It will ask you to fill in the below information for your project:
      (*note: hit 'Enter' to accept default for some options like version etc*)
      
       ``` $ name: (name of the project)```

       ``` $ version: (it normally shows this after version, eg. 0.0.1)```
       
       ```$ description: (describe what the project does)```
       
       ``` $ entry point: (file path to package, eg. ./app.js)```
       
       ``` $ test command: (eg. 'mocha' if you are using mocha for your tests)```
       
       ``` $ git repository: (link to the project on github)```
       
       ``` $ key words: (allow users to search for the project by keyword)```
       
       ``` $ author: (name)```
       
       ``` $ license: (somthing like 'MIT' - the license used for Ruby. It lets the user know what they can use the project for)```
      
  * The **package.jason file** will be created and automatically list any dependancies (modules/packages) used in your     project
    *(note: You can automatically add to the list in your package.jason file when you install additional packages from npm by
     adding the **flag --save**, eg. ```$npm install colors --save```)
* Open the **package.jason file** that should have been created in your project file. Add:
  ```    
  "engines": {
        "node": "4.2.4"
      }
  ```
* Create a new file in the main directory called **"Procfile"** *(like Gemfiles this starts with a capital letter and has no extension)*, you need to list at least one process in here, ```eg: $ web:node app.js```

* Git add, commit and push your changes, check you are logged into Heroku (note: you can look at extra Heroku commands once logged in by typing: heroku help)

* To add your app you first need to create it, type:
  ```$heroku apps: create <appname(needs to be unique)>```

* Test that the app is running locally by typing:
  ```$heroku local```

* It will probably give you a different port number to the one you specified in the app, so we need to update it to check the ENV variable:
  * In the app change the var for the port to the below (replace 1337 with whatever local port you are running on).
    ```var port = process.env.PORT || 1337;```
  * This will tell the app to run on the env port if specified or on the local port if not.

* Check if it is now working by running ```$heroku local``` again and ```$heroku open```

* Once you have confirmed it is working, you can push to the Heroku repository that has been created.
  ```$git push heroku master```

* You may see an application error if you declared a hostname in your app. The host name is optional so just take it out and add ```"oursite:"``` to the http://.

* Git add, commit and push to heroku again and it should work.
